Use this file to explain how your sploit1 works.
what is the bug in the corresponding target?
strcpy dost not stop at the len of the current string that is being copied. Thus, it will only end when it read an end-of-line char. thus we can force it to read mallicous code
how you exploit it?
after the correct size fo the string let the strcpy function read mallicous data. I put 8 bytes of hex values that will make the EIP go the the address of the root/shell call and there it will start the shell. the stack looks like this buffer[size = 200], ebp, eip 
where the various constants in your exploit come from?
