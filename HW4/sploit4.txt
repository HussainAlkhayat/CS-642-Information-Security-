Use this file to explain how your sploit4 works.
what is the bug in the corresponding target?
double free vulnerability
how you exploit it?
pointer qis freed twice

I mismaneged my time when doing this hw so i disnt do it but the main idea is the follwoing:
the buffer will be copied to p which is the space of the freed pointer q
using this we can write 4 bytes anywhere we want and similairy to sploit3 using 4 bytes we can run shell
