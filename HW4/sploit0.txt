Use this file to explain how your sploit0 works.

what is the bug in the corresponding target?
strcpy dost not stop at the len of the current string that is being copied. Thus, it will only end when it read an end-of-line char. thus we can force it to read mallicous code
how you exploit it?
pass in a buffer that is longer then expected and fill it with the foloowing: fill with junk, after the expected size which is 30 put the value of the stp then the addr of the jump if equal.
where the various constants in your exploit come from?
0xbffff848: stp value 
0x08048515: command "disassemble" and this is the value for the the command that will jump to line 30 which is "grade = 'A'"
