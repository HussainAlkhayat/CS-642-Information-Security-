Use this file to explain how your sploit3 works.
what is the bug in the corresponding target?
integer overflow vulnerability becuase of memcpy
how you exploit it?
filled my buffer with NOP's, than I copy into it the count value of -2147483889. this value will be casted from a unsigned long integer on the function strloul to a posativesigned integer of value 2147483407. will pass the "memcpy" condition in C, that is exactly my attack buffer size.
where the various constants in your exploit come from?
