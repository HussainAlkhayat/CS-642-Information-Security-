Use this file to explain how your sploit2 works.
what is the bug in the corresponding target?
very similar to strcpy but it only allowed 1 byte to read after the buffer (due to it going from 0 to len and NOT 0 to len - 1)
this lets us to overwrite the last byte in EBP 
how you exploit it?
altering EBP on the stack leads to altering ESP and make it goes to shellcode address on the EIP 
where the various constants in your exploit come from?
Shellcode Address: 0xbffffd28+ 156 - 4  = 0xbfffffd70 that is buffer addr + 156 for NOPS and shellcode and -4 becuase of th one byte
