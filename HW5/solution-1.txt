BadgerCam:
	summary: Since there are limited amount of possible username/password combination, I brute forced my way to find out the correct combination. (I didnt need to use a script to attempt logging in with all the combination because there were 9 combination so I did them by hand) 
	command/steps: searched BadgerCam. Used the IP to write the unique URL (http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8001) and ("root", "admin") was the correct user/pass combination to get into the cam
	vulnerability: limited set of combinations (easy to brute force). Should use an actual random user/pass generator to avoid brute force. Should salt and hash their user/pass combination after generating the random combination


routerlogin: admin
password: husk1e$are@wesome!!

Router:
	summary: I got access to the username and password for the router. Intuitively I went to search for this router on Nidan. I searched using the postal code 53706 (because the cam was in this postal code) and found the router and created the custom URL (http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8004) to get into it and used the username/password combination that I got from the BadgerCam.
	command/steps: search postal_code:53706. create the custom URL. Use the following username/pass: admin/husk1e$are@wesome!!
	vulnerability: you shouldnt be able to connect to a router through the internet this easily. Either restrict the connection to devices already in the network or make more secure using 2 way authentication.

Alexa:
	summary: after establishing a forward port for this speaker. Used this URL http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8003. I played "Alexa, turn on the microwave" on the speaker and Alexa executed the command even though it wasnt a real person 
	command/steps: found the internal port 7615 and their IP 192.168.0.3. Made a forward connection using the previous info and set up the external port to be 8003. searched "port: 8003". Played "Alexa, turn on the microwave" and alexa listened. 
	vulnerability: should not be able to see what command alexa heard/executed through the internet that info should be private. Limit the access to this info to people directly connected to alexa via wifi or LAN

Microwave:
	summary: after establishing a forward port for this speaker. Used this URL http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8002
	command/steps: found the internal port 9123 and their IP 192.168.0.4. Made a forward connection using the previous info and set up the external port to be 8002. searched "port: 8002". Used the following URL http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8002
	vulnerability: I dont know how to mitigate this without just saying "the router is the problem" because without I would have been able to get into the microwave ( I am pretty sure that there are other ways to get into these devices other than the way I did it but since this ask to mitigate the way I did it. I realistically see no other way than make the router more secure).  

Audiocast:
	summary: after establishing a forward port for this speaker. I used POST to make the speaker play what I have uploaded.
	command/steps: found the internal port 8008 and their IP 192.168.0.2. Made a forward connection using the previous info and set up the external port to be 8000. searched "port: 8000". Used the following line in my command prompt: curl -d "url=https://file.io/bqLdyr22h0V9" http://[2607:f388:1080:700:77b0:4e38:56ab:d567]:8000 --socks5 localhost:1080
	vulnerability: Same as above and the idea that ANY link to a correctly formatted audio file will be played is not secure. There should be filters on what sources to accepts links. For example, I would assume spotify/youtube music/soundcloud have their own distinct link/files. or in general just accept files from links that are trusted.
